# Tic-Tac-Woah!

A Tic-Tac-Toe engine that can play the game on any 2D surface!




### Backstory

In my Calc 2 class, we were... not paying attention... and started playing cursed Tic-Tac-Toe variants on the desks with markers. We came up with circular Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect-4 Tic-Tac-Toe, and many more crazy things.  
This gave me the idea to make this project!

A friend of mine had just made a game in WebGL, and I'd been wanting to learn it for a while, so that's the medium of this project!  
I don't care that it'll take longer... It'll look cooler, so it doesn't matter.
